# Digital-Signal-Processor
This repository contains a simple class that can perform digital signal processing algorithms. Right now, the class can only perform the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).

Credit goes to Catch2 for providing a testing framework. You can view their GitHub page [here](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x).
